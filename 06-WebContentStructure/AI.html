<ol>Key Concepts in AI

    <img src="AI.jpg" alt="AI">

    In relation to artificial intelligence,
    the following key concepts can be distinguished:
    <li>Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI
        that allows systems to learn from data and improve
        over time without being explicitly programmed.
        Examples include recommendation systems (like
        Netflix or YouTube) and fraud detection.</li>

    <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP): A branch of AI
        focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret,
        and generate human language. Applications include voice
        assistants like Siri or Alexa, chatbots, and language
        translation systems.</li>

    <li>Computer Vision: Enables machines to interpret
        and make decisions based on visual data from the world,
        such as images and videos. It's widely used in facial
        recognition, self-driving cars, and medical imaging.</li>

    <li>Robotics: AI powers robots, giving them the ability
        to perform tasks autonomously, often in environments
        that are too dangerous or complex for humans.</li>

    <li>Expert Systems: AI-based systems designed to mimic
        human expertise in specific domains, such as medical
        diagnosis or financial decision-making.</li>
</ol>
The data in the table shows four main areas of AI application:
natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning,
and reinforcement learning. Each area is related to a specific application,
such as chatbots, medical image analysis systems, or autonomous vehicles.
These applications have a significant impact on various sectors,
improving the efficiency of customer service, medical diagnostics,
protection against financial fraud, and the development of modern
technologies such as self-driving cars.
